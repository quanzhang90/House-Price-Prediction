# House-Price-Prediction

In this project, I evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes
in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain 
predictions about a house price. 

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each 
of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts.
